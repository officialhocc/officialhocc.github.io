This post will describe exploitation of the Kenobi device on [PracticalPenTestLabs](https://practicalpentestlabs.com/).

## Enumeration

As is tradition, we run a full nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -Pn -p 80,22 -A 10.0.1.7
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-07-03 14:53 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.0.1.7
Host is up (0.13s latency).

Nothing much to see here except SSH and HTTP. Which I have learned to be very common to just see SSH and HTTP on this particular CTF lab. Which is nice because it keeps you focused on performing web exploits vs. anything else. However, somebody put this box on baby mode because... see below.

So right off the bat we see that nmap performed a query to "Robots.txt" and pulled the contents of the text document.

Browsing the HTTP page gives us a very simple text that reads "Nothing to see here"

We check the source of the page to make sure there aren't any hidden messages and nothing. But we still have the robots.txt.

When we visit the url: http://10.0.1.7/secret/b0be1e547f7a5ee3ffd555428b019d9c.txt

We get our flag.... fetus mode enabled.

Not all machines on this site are designed to give you root access. These machines are designed to help you practice certain enumeration skills or exploitation skills. It's not your typical CTF but it does help those who need to find a rhythm and want to understand the basics of Penetration Testing. The key to any CTF is ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE. Never forget that.
