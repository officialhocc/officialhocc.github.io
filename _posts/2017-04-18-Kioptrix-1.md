The Kioptrix series was created by [@loneferret](https://twitter.com/loneferret) as a way of learning about different variations of linux. They are also designed to be very similar to those faced in the OSCP exam.  Since I'm eventually hoping to take this certification, this looked like a good candidate to learn from as they have been described as 'easy' in the sense that there aren't too many nasty traps.  The first to try is of course [Kioptrix: Level 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/)

As always, find the IP's of the box we want to target to ensure it's working.

```bash

Now lets do a port scan to see what services are open.

Browsing to the http server, we just a pretty simple welcome page, with not too much of interest.

I ran dirbuster hoping there was something more interesting on the server but this didn't turn up much. 

```bash

So after a lot of fruitless searching, I ended up looking for an Apache 1.3 exploit, hoping to use that as a route onto the server, but there was nothing that looked to give me a way onto the server.  I'd seen references to mod_ssl on a couple pages (in fact it's shown in the nmap scan too), so I tried that.
```bash
root@kali:~# searchsploit mod_ssl 2.8
```

* Apache mod_ssl 2.8.x - Off-by-One HTAccess Buffer Overflow  
* Apache mod_ssl < 2.8.7 OpenSSL - 'OpenFuckV2.c' Remote Exploit 
* Apache mod_ssl < 2.8.7 OpenSSL - 'OpenFuck.c' Remote Exploit 

Lo and behold we have three exploits available, with OpenFuckV2 looking to be a way to get us onto the server.

So I downloaded OpenFuckV2 and compiled it according to the changes made [here](http://paulsec.github.io/blog/2014/04/14/updating-openfuck-exploit/).  

```bash
gcc -o OpenFuck 764.c -lcrypto
```

Unfortunately, upon compiling, I got this error.

```bash
764.c:646:24: error: ‘SSL2_MAX_CONNECTION_ID_LENGTH’ undeclared here (not in a function)

```

So, I'm including the error log here in case you stumbled across this page while googling.  The reason it seems, according to an unknown user in the comments of [this writeup](http://poc-hack.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/kioptrix-hacking-challenge-level-1-part.html), is that the wrong version of libssl is installed.  This is fixed by installing an older version.

```bash
apt-get install libssl1.0-dev
```

So now we need to specify the shellcode we want to send depending on the install.  If you run the binary you'll see a list of all the possibles, but two stand out considering the known apache version and that there is a reference to Red Hat in the nmap scan and peppered around some random exposed files. From this we know that we want 0x6a or 0x6b.  0x6a yielded nothing but 0x6b got us a shell.

```bash

```

So the ptrace-kmod.c file didn't work for some reason.  Not having actually read it I didn't realise this was what allowed us to get root so I spent a much longer time than I want to admit trying to find some other vulnerabilities.  After going to back to square one however, I realised this was what would help us get root on the box.  So I downloaded it to the box, compiled and ran.

```bash
bash-2.05$ gcc -o ptrace ptrace-kmod.c
gcc -o ptrace ptrace-kmod.c
bash-2.05$ ./ptrace
./ptrace

```

Boom we have root!  All in all this is quite a simple box but really helped me bridge that gap in understanding how to use an exploit to compromise a server and actually going about it and troubleshooting issues along the way.  I'd highly recommend this, if like me you are new to security and looking to learn more about actually using exploits and information gathering to compromise a system.
