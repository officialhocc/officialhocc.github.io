This post will describe exploitation of the Taddeo device on [PracticalPenTestLabs](https://practicalpentestlabs.com/).

## Enumeration

As is tradition, we run a full nmap scan:

```bash
Easy File Sharing Web Server httpd 6.9nmap -p80 -A 10.0.2.13
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-07-04 11:22 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.13
Host is up (0.092s latency).

This one is going to be a very quick one, frankly. I am not sure if this machine was supposed to be exploited this way but... As you can see from our Nmap scan we get one port back which is port 80. Using the -A flag gives us more information on the port and from this we can see that there is a program called "Easy File Sharing Web Server httpd 6.9" running. This is good, so we know that is we visit this webpage we will more than likely be able to view files.

Visiting the HTTP page give us a login page. Hmm... how can we gain credentials? Wait... if we take another look there is a option called "Login as a Guest". Let's try that.

Boom! we're in. Unfortunately for the admin, they didn't configure this application properly so even a guest user can access any files on the system. Now we could browse Exploit-DB and locate a exploit that would grant us remote access but for this CTF there is no need.

We capture the secret.txt flag and call this one complete.
