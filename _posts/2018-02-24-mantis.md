This writeup details attaching the Mantis machine from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/login).

![](https://image.ibb.co/bx0iJH/image.png)

In short this machine looked indomitable at the start with it's ridiculous list of open ports.  Targeted enumeration, however, reveals that it's not as bad as first expected.

That is a long list of ports!  We need to see what we can identify about this from the port scan and attack the high value ports first.  

From port 88, the kerberos port we can deduce that this machine is a member of a Windows Active Directory Environment. Port 389, the LDAP service port, confirms this suspicion.  From this information we can make the reasonable assumption that we are attacking a Windows Domain Controller.

The machine is also running web-services on port 1337 and port 8080.  1337 merely shows the default IIS index page, whilst 8080 has a blog powered by Orchard CMS:

![The name is not lost on me.](https://image.ibb.co/g9fAxc/image.png)

Running a dirbuster on both services reveals that a`/secure_notes/` directory exists on port 1337.  Inside we see two files:

![](https://image.ibb.co/e3Tfxc/image.png)

`web.config` isn't actually readable but let's have a look inside `dev_notes_NmQyNDI0NzE2YzVmNTM0MDVmNTA0MDczNzM1NzMwNzI2NDIx.txt.txt`:
```
1. Download OrchardCMS
2. Download SQL server 2014 Express ,create user "admin",and create orcharddb database
3. Launch IIS and add new website and point to Orchard CMS folder location.
4. Launch browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
5. Set admin password and configure sQL server connection string.
6. Add blog pages with admin user.
```
So we know there's a database user called admin used to create the orcharddb database, but we're still in need of a password.  Looking at the filename, the last part of the filename looks like it's a base64 encoded string.  We can decode this quite easily:

```python
>>> import base64
>>> base64.b64decode('NmQyNDI0NzE2YzVmNTM0MDVmNTA0MDczNzM1NzMwNzI2NDIx')
'6d2424716c5f53405f504073735730726421'
```
The result of the decoding is a hex string.  It could be a hash, but to ensure it's not just hex-encoded, we run a quick decode:
```python
>>> '6d2424716c5f53405f504073735730726421'.decode('hex')
'm$$ql_S@_P@ssW0rd!'
```
Well that looks like our MS-SQL password!


### MS-SQL Credentials
For MS-SQL, metasploit has a number of inbuilt modules, but I've found them to be fairly buggy in the past, so working with `sqsh` allows us to manually enumerate with the database. 

The password implies it's for the `sa` user, but connecting with that yields no result.  Connecting with username `admin` however, does.  We use the following:
```bash
sqsh -U admin -S 10.10.10.52
```
As a quick aside, it's worthwhile to check whenever working with an MS-SQL database is the presence of higher privileges.  We can check these manually, but a quick check is to see if you can access `advanced options`.  As we see below, we don't have the necessary permissions:
```
1> exec sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> go
Msg 15247, Level 16, State 1
Server 'MANTIS\SQLEXPRESS', Procedure 'sp_configure', Line 105
User does not have permission to perform this action.
(return status = 1)
```
Enumerating the database, we check the OrchardDB for the presence of any left over user records:
```
1> SELECT Username, Password FROM blog_Orchard_Users_UserPartRecord;
2> go
```
This yields the following user accounts:
``` 
admin:Password1234 
James:J@m3s_P@ssW0rd! 
```

We test both credentials on a number of services, but it turns out he's not even a user within the installed OrchardCMS on port 8080.  Trying it on a number of services, it turns out he's a user on the Windows Machine itself.
```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sU -sS --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p U:139,T:139 10.10.10.52

MS14-068
------------
In short, the vulnerability targeted the kerberos service, and allowed any user to elevate their permissions from regular user, to domain admin by forging a kerberos ticket.  This is quite a well known exploit and it's always worth checking if interacting with an out of date domain controller if you have a lower privileged user.

The Impacket [goldenPac](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/blob/master/examples/goldenPac.py) script is about as point-and-click as this attack gets in all honesty.  It handles the more annoying parts such as fetching the SID, and authorizing with the kerberos ticket.  We run it as below and are almost instantly returned a shell:

```
