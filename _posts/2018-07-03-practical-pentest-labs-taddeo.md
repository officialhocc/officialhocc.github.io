This post will describe exploitation of the Taddeo device on [PracticalPenTestLabs](https://practicalpentestlabs.com/).

## Enumeration

As is tradition, we run a full nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -Pn -p22,80,3128 -A 10.0.3.10
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-07-03 21:30 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.0.3.10
Host is up (0.094s latency).

So immediately we get a few ports we can browse. Based on what we know about this CTF network. More than likely our shell will be from the HTTP. Because we used the "-A" flag. Nmap enumerated the HTTP website and gathered some additional information that can help us prepare a plan of attack.

On the HTTP landing page, we are greeted with a directory listing. Within this listing we have a few options: phpinfo.php; config.php & file.php

Phpinfo.php gives us additional information on the target machine. But nothing else was gained from this page.

Config.php was blank. It is possible there is content in this file but we can read the contents.

File.php is interesting however, when we visit this page. We are greeted by a comment that says " Please specify the 'name' parameter" Okay. So if we visit "http://10.0.3.10/file.php?name=" We more than likely will get LFI.

And Lo and Behold we get /etc/passwd by visiting http://10.0.3.10/file.php?name=/////////////////etc/passwd. Great, so now we have a user on the machine name Taddeo. We'll need this later for SSH. Now that we know we can read system files, let's see what's inside the Config.php.

By using the PHP filters we can prevent PHP code executing when used in Local File Inclusion. So we visit "http://10.0.3.10/file.php?name=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php" Returned is a base64 encoded string. We will need to decode this before getting the contents of the php config file. We can do this in the command line by executing:

```bash 
echo "PD9waHAKZGVmaW5lKCAnREJfTkFNRScsICd0ZXN0JyApOwoKLyoqIE15U1FMIGRhdGFiYXNlIHVzZXJuYW1lICovCmRlZmluZSggJ0RCX1VTRVInLCAndGFkZGVvJyApOwoKLyoqIE15U1FMIGRhdGFiYXNlIHBhc3N3b3JkICovCmRlZmluZSggJ0RCX1BBU1NXT1JEJywgJ3RhZGRlb0AzMjEnICk7CgovKiogTXlTUUwgaG9zdG5hbWUgKi8KZGVmaW5lKCAnREJfSE9TVCcsICdsb2NhbGhvc3QnICk7Cgo/Pgo=" | base64 -d 
```

Once executed we will get the contents which gives us a password. Although this is a password used in MySQL. It is very common for users to re-use passwords. So let's try this out on the SSH port 22 with the user Taddeo.

We have a shell! Awesome, but the job isn't over yet. We will need to get root access now. We fire up LinuxPrivChecker.py annnnd. Nothing, nothing interesting. Which is fine because we have a few other tricks up our sleeves before we really start digging deep. But you should always try the quick and dirty tricks first before spending a ridiculous amount of time trying to get root shell. Most times, the answer is right in front of you. Now this version is vulnerable to DirtyCow. However, DirtyCow is also Dirty and more often than not will crash these machines. So best not to use it. What we do have however is a nice prompt when we execute:
```bash
Sudo -l
```
What it reads is:
```bash
User taddeo may run the following commands on TADDEO:

    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
This is good. So we can run programs as sudo without using a password. So let's execute:
```bash
Sudo -s
```
and see if we can get a root shell.

and Tadaa! We have root and our flag.

Browsing the HTTP page gives us a very simple text that reads "Nothing to see here"

We check the source of the page to make sure there aren't any hidden messages and nothing. But we still have the robots.txt.

When we visit the url: http://10.0.1.7/secret/b0be1e547f7a5ee3ffd555428b019d9c.txt

We get our flag.... fetus mode enabled.

Not all machines on this site are designed to give you root access. These machines are designed to help you practice certain enumeration skills or exploitation skills. It's not your typical CTF but it does help those who need to find a rhythm and want to understand the basics of Penetration Testing. The key to any CTF is ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE. Never forget that.
